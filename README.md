##cPANEL

Công cụ quản trị web hosting này có giao diện thân thiện với người dùng và hoạt động trên hệ thống phân cấp ba lớp như sau:

- Hosting company (Nhà cung cấp dịch vụ hosting).

- Reseller.

- End User (Người dùng cuối).

`Hosting company` và `Reseller` sử dụng giao diện tương tự có tên là web host manager(WHM) – Trình quản lý máy chủ web (WHM) trong đó hosting company có quyền quản trị cao nhất và có thể hạn chế quyền truy cập vào một số tính năng nhất định trong Reseller WHM. End user có quyền truy cập trực tiếp vào cPanel interface nơi họ có thể thực hiện một loạt các tác vụ cho trang web của mình.

Ngoài ra, `cPanel` cũng có khả năng cho phép các nhà cung cấp bên thứ 3 tích hợp dịch vụ của họ vào để khách hàng có thể sử dụng dịch vụ ngay trong giao diện cPanel. Công cụ quản trị web hosting này có thể sử dụng trên máy chủ vật lý hoặc máy chủ ảo (VPS) sử dụng hệ điều hành CentOS, RedHat Enterprise Linux, CloudLinux hoặc FreeBSD. cPanel hỗ trợ Apache , MySQL và PHP cũng như các giao thức email phổ biến bao gồm POP3, IMAP và SMTP. End user sẽ sử dụng hosting cPanel bằng cách truy cập qua cổng 2083.

cPanel is a Linux-based web hosting control panel, designed to automate the processes involved with running a web server.

A few of the core web hosting processes that are automated via the cPanel software are:

    - Server Security
    - Domain & DNS
    - Email Handling
    - File Transfer & Management
    - Database Handling
    - Logging

cPanel & WHM allows hosting providers and users the ability to automate server management tasks while offering your customers the tools they need to manage their sites. One of our older, but still very relevant videos does a great job of explaining how cPanel & WHM benefit the web hosting industry.

cPanel is one of the most popular Linux-based control panels for web hosting. It lets you conveniently manage all services in a single place. 

Currently, cPanel is the industry standard, and most web developers are well-acquainted with it.

Intuitive and easy to use, cPanel empowers you to manage a web hosting account with maximum efficiency, whether that’s creating new FTP users and email addresses or monitoring resources, creating subdomains and installing the software.


What it means

So now we know what cPanel is - but what exactly does it mean to be a web hosting control panel? As the video in the last unit mentions, one of cPanel’s goals has always been to make web hosting accessible to everyone. 

This works by making administration tasks simple and by allowing for self-sufficiency. Where in the past, users would constantly need to request assistance from the server administrator to make any adjustments to their accounts or environment, cPanel allows users to do it themselves.

This means that administrators can focus on making sure that the server is stable and working smoothly, while the users have the freedom and flexibility to establish a web hosting environment that’s best for them, additionally allowing for the administrator (and/or resellers) to define constraints and restrictions as needed.

A simple click of the button now performs the tasks that might have originally taken hours.

Here’s an example:

To add a new website, one of the things you would need to do on a server is to create something called a VirtualHost entry, by manually adding it into a configuration file on the server. 

This involved understanding the syntax of that configuration file, and constructing values to represent each option you needed to define. This needed to be done independently for SSL and non-SSL access.

With cPanel, this all takes place automatically.

When a user creates a domain, the configurations are updated automatically, including backups (just in case). 

The server administrator doesn’t even need to be involved for this to happen. The end-user, or web hosting customer, then fills out a simple form within their own personal cPanel interface, after which point they can simply click a button.


\Why do we need one?
Why do we need a control panel?

Want an honest answer? We don't need them.

We do, however, want them.

Like almost all innovation in technology, humans want to make things easier, more efficient, and just plain faster. We created the remote control so we didn’t have to get off of the couch. 

We all bought microwaves so we wouldn’t have to wait so long for food to cook. We created cars because horses and walking were just too slow.

it goes a little deeper than that with control panels, however, and even with computing in general.

cPanel (and control panels in general) automates processes so that web hosting becomes simpler. 

This, in turn, makes web hosting realistic for a wider range of people to have access to, regardless of income or skill level.

This applies not only to web hosting customers, but also web hosts themselves, because they are now able to administer their servers, and as a result their company, using a simple, unified, and automated graphical interface.

What can I do with cPanel?

Now, hopefully, you have a better picture of the role that control panels and cPanel have when it comes to the internet. You might even feel ready to dive into your own cPanel interface, but if you want to be equipped to make the most of it, you’ll need to know what you can actually do.

There’s a LOT you can do with cPanel, even with minimal feature access. In fact, there’s so much you can do that we can’t possibly cover it all in one simple introduction unit. Later on, you will learn more about those features in the Administration Tier 2 cPanel Essentials certification course. The course is comprised of videos that provide coverage of many available features in the cPanel interface.

In addition to the training videos in Tier 2, cPanel has many video tutorials, documentation, and interface overviews. When you're going through our training courses, feel free to supplement by exploring the content delivered right from the source. It’s easier to follow than you might expect.


#####
What is a cPanel account?

It may seem like a silly question. If you use cPanel, you have an account. Simple as that, right?

Well, it actually gets a little more interesting. You may or may not be aware, but the account you log into cPanel with might actually be one of many that exist on a single server.

You can think of it as an apartment building. Each cPanel interface would exist as one apartment in the building. You can do anything you want inside the apartment, within the rules of the landlord, but you can’t change the building itself.

The landlord(s), however, makes sure that everyone is taken care of. Any building maintenance that needs to take place goes through the landlord.

In this analogy, the server admin is the landlord. And... as you’d expect, they have their own interface to manage the server, and to perform the necessary maintenance.

The administration interface is called WebHost Manager, or WHM. Administrators log into WHM using the root user for the system, which is the user that can do anything it wants on the server, with no restrictions.

    - Your cPanel account has the cPanel interface to help you access a designated portition of the server.

    - The server itself has WHM interface to help administrators access everything on server, including any accounts.

Some server admins may provide cPanel accounts with access to more than other servers’ admins; this is solely determined and implemented at the administrators' own discretion.

Who is my host?

So who really hosts my website?

There are countless amounts of cPanel users out there who may at times obtain access to the account or domain via the transfer of responsibilities, for one reason or another. 

Often, this process happens with very little information provided.

Then, at some point, the time comes that a change in their site necessitates assistance from the server administrator. 

The question arises: 
Who IS the server administrator?

In order to contact the admin, they need to first find out who their hosting provider is. This is not always as simple as it might seem.

One common mistake is to think that cPanel itself is the hosting provider. What cPanel actually provides is simply a piece of software that generates the interface that you see when you log into your account. 

Hosting providers purchase this software for use on their own servers. They are fully responsible for managing and administering their own servers.

cPanel has no ownership of the server or the accounts within it, even if it uses our software. As a result, all necessary changes to the server must be relayed through the hosting providers themselves.


One way that users can confirm this information is via the WHOIS records. Alternatively, the DNS servers’ domains can occasionally reveal this information.

Often, however, the results of these can still not definitively point to any particular hosting provider. Luckily, there are other ways to identify this information.

How to Identify your Hosting Provider
In our official Knowledgebase, we have a detailed article that provides steps you can take to determine who your domain’s actual hosting provider is, and what to do if you still come up empty.

You can find this article by clicking the button to the right.

How to Identify Your Hosting Provider

Many cPanel users contact WebPros International, LLC for technical support or other inquiries. But, in most cases, you should contact your hosting provider instead. This document will help you to identify your hosting provider.

You may want to contact your hosting provider for the following types of issues:

    - Forgotten usernames or passwords.
    - Purchases of additional storage space, bandwidth, or other resources.
    - Technical problems.
    - Payment or billing inquiries.

I thought that cPanel was my hosting provider?

Your hosting provider is the company that you pay to host your website. WebPros International, LLC is a software company that creates web hosting automation software. We then sell (license) this software to individual hosting companies. These companies then sell hosting space to individual customers. This is why you might see our logo or other information when you log in to your website.


Warning:

WebPros International, LLC does not own and cannot access the server that stores your website’s information. So, unfortunately, we cannot help you with most requests.

If you encounter any any flaws in our product, you must relay them to your hosting provider. We will then work directly with your hosting provider to resolve the issue.

##
Identify your hosting provider

To identify your hosting provider, perform the following actions:

    - Navigate to Whois Domain Lookup. This website allows you to search for a domain name’s hosting provider.
    
    Note:
    
    - While this article uses Whois Domain Lookup, other similar search sites also exist, such as Webbium’s webhostingdetector.com. WebPros International, LLC is not affiliated with either of these third-party sites.

What do you mean by resources?

You may hear or read the term resources used in the context of servers, domains, hosting, or any other computing topic. This, in general, refers to the system components that allow a server to perform its tasks; usually memory/RAM availability, hard disk (both performance and disk space), CPU processing power, and bandwidth/throughput.

We mentioned earlier that a single cPanel & WHM server may manage any number of accounts within it. In order to avoid having a situation where one of those accounts ends up using ALL of the server’s resources (leaving the other accounts with nothing), each account is instead limited to a finite amount of resources, as defined by the administrator.

In the cPanel interface (which we’ll cover further within the cPanel Professional-tier of coursework) users are able to see exactly how much of and what kind of resources have been allocated to them. This can impact the potential speed, size, and complexity that sites within your account can reach.

If you have any confusion about what resources are allocated to your account, or if you suspect a discrepancy between what was stated and what you’re seeing in the account, get in touch with your hosting provider to ensure that you are getting the most out of your site.

Where can I find out more?

Being Resourceful

You may not have direct access to the system that your cPanel account lives on, but the more you understand about it, the better you’ll be at knowing how to effectively manage your cPanel account, and how to improve the site you host within it.

Take a look at our cPanel Professional video-based certification course for more on this topic. Until then, however, go through our online video tutorials(https://www.youtube.com/user/cpaneltv/videos), documentation(https://docs.cpanel.net/), and interface overview(https://docs.cpanel.net/cpanel/the-cpanel-interface/the-cpanel-interface/) to get a head start.

cPanel Fundamentals DNS
############

DNS

The World's  Address Book

DNS, meaning Domain Name System, is at its core, simply a way to convert easily-remembered names (domains) into not-so-easy to remember numbers. This is how we reach the websites on the internet that we all know and love. To most people, the idea of a website and the idea of a domain are basically synonymous. However, when talking about DNS, they actually become very different things.

A website is where you have the content. The words, the images, the videos, the files themselves. Whereas a domain is what you use to find the website.

In the URL bar, you see the domain (cpanel.net) and in the main window, underneath, you can see the website.

DNS is kind of like your phone contacts...

You probably remember that your friend is Pete, but you might not remember what his phone number is off the top of your head.

Luckily, we've got these handy smart phones that store all of our favorite contacts, right? You can just look up the name, push "Call", and it deals with the number part all on its own.

That's really all that DNS is doing, on a surface level. Behind the scene, though, it takes quite a bit of software and infrastructure to make the internet do what it does.

There are really two ways that DNS resolution can happen on a server: Either the record exists in a file on the server called the hosts file, or it gets handled by the DNS server software.

The DNS server software is the basis behind what is referred to as a nameserver. These take in requests for domain names on the internet, or on any network, and respond by telling them where to go to find them.

In the early days of the universe...

No, we don't need to go that far back. In the early days of the internet, there was so little content and so few computers connected to it, that each computer maintained a list of names in that single file we mentioned earlier, called the hosts file.

This file was used to list the domain name and the IP Address, identifying the location of that domain's files. Every time there was a change, each user would edit their respective hosts file with the new information.

Eventually of course, this continued to grow until it became apparent that requiring everyone to manually modify a file with every new domain or IP change was just not a reasonable solution.

And so, nameserver software was developed. Up until 1998, the location of the nameservers for each domain was solely handled by a company known as Network Solutions.

Things have changed, though! And for the better. The reality was, as it usually is, a little more complicated. It all lead to where we are now, which brings us to our next discussion...

So how does DNS work?

Alright, we've talked about how it works on the surface level (name → IP, etc.), but the stuff that's more important for our purposes is going to need to go a little deeper. We don't have to get down to the nitty-gritty, but let's get some basics out of the way, starting with resolvers.

A resolver, also called a resolving nameserver, is just a server that responds to DNS requests for domain names that it is not authoritative.

A resolver, also called a resolving nameserver, is just a server that responds to DNS requests for domain names that it is not authoritative.

So what qualifies as authoritative? When someone refers to a nameserver as being authoritative for a domain, they mean that the nameserver they're referring to is the best place to find the current info for that domain; the "official" source, so-to-speak.

For most domains, a WHOIS search would allow you to determine what nameservers are authoritative for it. These only exist in the WHOIS records because whoever registered that domain provided those nameservers along with it.

This means that the registrar (the place that the WHOIS record is retrieved from, and where the domain is registered) can, in effect, be one of the first points of potential failure if DNS resolution isn't working.

If other types of nameservers handle DNS requests for domains that they are authoritative for, then one needs to be able to find anything they are not authoritative for, which is typically the rest of the internet. This is where a resolver comes in.
